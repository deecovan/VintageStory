I am very much enjoying this fork. In combination with Terra Prety, the rivers create wonderful vallies edged by sweeping hills and cliffs, and, since the water is static and not flowing, travel by boat is possible along the rivers in both directions, leading to a world where boats are actually useful.

Below is a link to a pastboard image of the world map.
